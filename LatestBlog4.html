                                    <p>Like many other forts in Maharashtra, Ratangad was strategically placed to defend itself on a hilltop in the Sahyadri mountain range. This fort was used to control and keep an eye on activity inside the area and manage important trade routes.</p>
									<p>Ratangad was owned by a string of Maratha rulers throughout history. This fort had strategic importance under Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj's rule. To protect his kingdom from intruders, Shivaji Maharaj charged and sustained various forts in the Sahyadri range, notably Ratangad.</p>
                                    <p>By considering these things, it's clear that Ratangad Fort serves as both a reminder of the area's rich military, cultural, and architectural history and a tribute to its turbulent past. and it continues to attract tourists today due to its scenic beauty and historical significance. </p>
